Presently, the Makefile is designed to produce Type1 outline fonts
by using the "mftrace" tool.  If you have the tool available and
in your PATH, you can simply invoke

        make all

or

        make dist

to produce Type1 fonts or a tar.gz distribution file.  The Makefile also 
has rules for building TrueType and bitmap versions of Claudius Roman built
will require minor editing to enable this.

claudius-regular.mf and claudius-bold.mf contain the parameters for
producing the regular and boldface versions of the font respectively. Just
about all the other common parameters are found in claudius.mf.
